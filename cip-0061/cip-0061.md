# Abstract
**Tenzor Capital** proposes to join the Canton Network as a Super Validator (weight 5) by integrating two of its portfolio companies - **Midl** and **deBridge** - into  **Canton’s infrastructure**.

Through coordinated technical delivery and performance-driven adoption goals, **Tenzor Capital** will deliver:
* Cross-chain liquidity via  **deBridge** - Mainnet deployment of a Canton adapter enabling secure, high-throughput asset transfers between Canton and other chains, with seamless wallet onboarding for users bridging in and out of Canton.
* Bitcoin integration via  **Midl** - Enabling Canton assets to be used in Bitcoin-native smart contracts once EVM support is live, attracting liquidity from both EVM ecosystems and native Bitcoin holders.

These integrations will address Canton’s current limitations in native Bitcoin access and cross-chain liquidity, while driving measurable adoption through wallet connections, transaction volumes and protocol usage.


# About Applicants
**Tenzor Capital:**
* Early-stage Web3 venture firm operating a $50M liquid stable-asset fund.
* Backed 25+ infrastructure and DeFi projects since 2017.
* Strong technical team with experience in yield-bearing vault infrastructure, stable-asset mechanics, on-chain automations, bridging solutions and user interface design.
* Strategic position as both investor and coordinator enables smooth alignment of technical roadmaps and delivery timelines across portfolio companies for Canton-focused integrations.

Portfolio companies in scope:
* **Midl** - Bitcoin-native smart contract infrastructure enabling DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs using native BTC wallets, designed to attract liquidity from both EVM ecosystems and native Bitcoin.
* **deBridge** - Cross-chain interoperability protocol for secure asset and message transfers, unlocking production-grade, scalable liquidity flows across multiple blockchains.

# Motivation
Current challenges in **Canton**:
* No standardised, production-ready path for cross-chain liquidity - current solutions lock up liquidity and require custom integrations, slowing growth.
* No direct access to native Bitcoin assets - existing solutions rely on wrapped tokens or custodians, limiting adoption from Bitcoin-native users.

How this proposal solves them:
* **deBridge** integration - Delivers a ready-to-use, audited Canton adapter for high-speed, secure bridging of assets and messages between Canton and other chains.
* **Midl** integration - Allows Canton assets to interact directly with Bitcoin-native smart contracts, tapping into the largest crypto asset base and increasing liquidity inflow.

# Specification


## Interoperability Bridge
* **Provider:** deBridge (Leading intent based bridge infrastructure).  
* **Scope:** connect Canton to EVM, Solana and other supported chains.  
* **Features:** message-based, liquidity-free transfers; extensible IaaS adapter framework.  
* **Timeline:** production release ≤ 6 months after CIP approval.

## Bitcoin Liquidity Integration
* **Provider:** Midl.  
* **Scope:** integrate Canton into Midl’s infrastructure, enabling direct BTC wallet support and Bitcoin-native assets without wrapping.  
* **Timeline:** ≤ 6 months after CIP approval.

# Deliverables for full SV Reward:

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |
|-------------|--------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Midl Integration – Technical Delivery** | • Midl smart contracts & technical stack prepared for Canton-side EVM integration.<br>• Security review passed.<br>• Canton assets usable in Bitcoin-native Midl contracts upon EVM availability. | ≤ 6 months from CIP approval | **1.0 total** — 0.3 contracts ready, 0.3 security review, 0.4 assets live |
| **Midl Whitepaper** | • Whitepaper describing technical architecture and integration process published before go-live. | ≤ 3 months from CIP approval | 0.2 |
| **Midl Performance KPI** | • +0.3 per 500 unique Canton wallets interacting with Bitcoin-native Midl contracts.<br>• Measured within the first year after go-live. | First year after go-live | Max 1.5 |
| **deBridge Integration – Technical Delivery** | • Mainnet deployment of deBridge Canton adapter.<br>• Security review passed.<br>• First asset transfer to/from Canton successful. | ≤ 4 months from CIP approval | **1.0 total** — 0.4 mainnet deployment, 0.3 security review, 0.3 first transfer |
| **deBridge Whitepaper** | • Whitepaper describing bridging architecture and Canton adapter implementation published before go-live. | ≤ 3 months from CIP approval | 0.2 |
| **deBridge Performance KPI** | • +0.3 per 1,000 unique wallets bridged to/from Canton.<br>• Measured within the first year after go-live. | First year after go-live | Max 1.5 |

**Total Weight Possible:** 5.0

# Milestone Mechanics:
* The GSF Tokenomics committee will evaluate each milestone and verify progress towards the deliverables outlined in this CIP.
* The Midl and Tenzor Capital team will provide a written progress update every 60 days from CIP approval, including updates on user adoption, deployment status, and technical integration milestones.

# Rationale
* **deBridge** already supports EVM, Solana and other ecosystems with fast, liquidity-free transfers and a modular adapter framework, making it a natural fit for Canton integration.  
* **Midl** provides Bitcoin-native smart-contract infrastructure, unlocking BTC liquidity for DeFi use cases without wrapping. Integration enables institutional Canton liquidity (US Treasuries, stablecoins, tokenized securities) to be used within a Bitcoin-native environment. Canton assets become programmable in Midl contracts for lending, AMMs and derivatives - all with compliant and secure execution.
These components directly address the gaps identified in *Motivation*.

# Backwards Compatibility
Purely additive; no changes to consensus rules or existing smart-contract semantics.

# Reference Implementation
* deBridge Canton adapter (open-sourced under Apache-2.0).  
* Midl Canton integration module (Apache-2.0).

# Security Considerations
* Validators operated with HSM-based key custody, multi-site redundancy and 24 / 7 monitoring.  
* deBridge design removes liquidity pools, reducing attack surface compared to lock-and-mint bridges.  
* Midl employs threshold-signature custody for BTC assets.
