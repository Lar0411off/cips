# Abstract
Add the joint team of **Midl** and **Tenzor Capital** as a Tier-2 Super Validator (weight 3) on the Canton Network to deliver:

* Mainnet deployment of a deBridge Canton adapter plus 1 000 unique wallets bridged to/from Canton within **4 months** of CIP approval; 
* Launch of a fractional-reserve protocol on Canton (white-paper, smart-contract deployment and 2 000 unique holders) within **6 months**; 
* Bitcoin integration via Midl — Midl smart-contracts and tech-stack ready for Canton-side EVM, with Canton assets usable in Bitcoin-native Midl contracts once EVM is live — within **6 months**.

# About Applicants
**Midl**:
* Midl is the first Bitcoin-native dApp infrastructure enabling smart contract execution directly on Bitcoin without bridges or custodians.
* Users and developers can interact with DeFi, stablecoins, NFTs and other EVM-like applications using native BTC wallets - making Bitcoin truly programmable.
* Backed by Draper and other top-tier VCs, Midl is live on testnet, onboarding 20+ projects with audited core modules and early integrations underway.

**Tenzor Capital**:
* Tenzor Capital is an early-stage Web3 venture firm backing builders since 2017 and operating a $50 million liquid stable-asset fund.
* Its portfolio spans 25+ infrastructure and DeFi projects, including deBridge, Zyfi, Sats Terminal and other cross-chain middleware teams.
* Tenzor’s technical team brings practical know-how in yield-bearing vault infrastructure, stable-asset mechanics, on-chain automations, bridging solutions and user-facing interface design.

# Motivation
Canton currently lacks (1) a standardised, production-grade path for cross-chain liquidity and (2) native access to Bitcoin assets. Existing bridges immobilise liquidity and require bespoke integrations, slowing ecosystem growth.

# Specification

## Validator
| Field        | Value                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Entity       | Midl and Tenzor Capital                      |
| Tier         | 2 (weight 3)                          |
| Role         | Super Validator                       |

## Interoperability Bridge
* **Provider:** deBridge (Leading intent based bridge infrastructure).  
* **Scope:** connect Canton to EVM, Solana and other supported chains.  
* **Features:** message-based, liquidity-free transfers; extensible IaaS adapter framework.  
* **Timeline:** production release ≤ 4 months after CIP approval.

## Bitcoin Liquidity Integration
* **Provider:** Midl.  
* **Scope:** integrate Canton into Midl’s infrastructure, enabling direct BTC wallet support and Bitcoin-native assets without wrapping.  
* **Timeline:** ≤ 6 months after CIP approval.

# Deliverables for full SV Reward:

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Canton Interoperability Bridge** | • Mainnet deployment of deBridge Canton adapter (with security review)<br>• 1 000 unique wallets bridged to / from Canton | ≤ 4 months from CIP approval | • 0.5 weight for mainnet adapter<br>• 0.5 weight for 1 000 wallets |
| **Fractional-Reserve Protocol Launch** | • Whitepaper published describing the launch of a fractional-reserve protocol utilizing a self-coordinating, duration-matched autonomous balance sheet<br>• Smart contracts deployed on Canton<br>• 2 000 unique holders on Canton | ≤ 6 months from CIP approval | • 0.2 weight for white paper<br>• 0.3 weight for contracts live<br>• 0.5 weight for 2 000 holders |
| **Bitcoin Integration via Midl** (requires EVM module readiness on Canton side) | • Midl smart contracts & technical stack prepared for Canton-side EVM integration<br>• Canton assets usable in Bitcoin-native Midl contracts upon EVM availability | ≤ 6 months from CIP approval | • 0.5 weight upon contracts & stack readiness<br>• 0.5 weight once assets are usable on Bitcoin-native Midl |

# Milestone Mechanics:
* The GSF Tokenomics committee will evaluate each milestone and verify progress towards the deliverables outlined in this CIP.
* The Midl and Tenzor Capital team will provide a written progress update every 60 days from CIP approval, including updates on user adoption, deployment status, and technical integration milestones.


# Rationale
* **deBridge** already supports EVM, Solana and other ecosystems with fast, liquidity-free transfers and a modular adapter framework, making it a natural fit for Canton integration.  
* **Midl** provides Bitcoin-native smart-contract infrastructure, unlocking BTC liquidity for DeFi use cases without wrapping. Integration enables institutional Canton liquidity (US Treasuries, stablecoins, tokenized securities) to be used within a Bitcoin-native environment. Canton assets become programmable in Midl contracts for lending, AMMs and derivatives - all with compliant and secure execution.
These components directly address the gaps identified in *Motivation*.

# Backwards Compatibility
Purely additive; no changes to consensus rules or existing smart-contract semantics.

# Reference Implementation
* deBridge Canton adapter (open-sourced under Apache-2.0).  
* Midl Canton integration module (Apache-2.0).

# Security Considerations
* Validators operated with HSM-based key custody, multi-site redundancy and 24 / 7 monitoring.  
* deBridge design removes liquidity pools, reducing attack surface compared to lock-and-mint bridges.  
* Midl employs threshold-signature custody for BTC assets.
