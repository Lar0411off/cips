# Abstract
Add **3 Commas Capital** as a Tier-2 Super Validator (weight 3) on the Canton Network and, together with its portfolio projects **deBridge** and **Midl**, deliver:

* a production-ready, liquidity-free interoperability bridge between Canton and major chains (EVM, Solana, …) within **4 months** of CIP approval;  
* native support for Bitcoin liquidity and BTC-denominated assets in Canton smart contracts within the same **4 months**;  
* 3–5 pilot projects with leading financial institutions and corporations across Europe and the Middle East within **6 months**.

# Motivation
Canton currently lacks (1) a standardised, production-grade path for cross-chain liquidity and (2) native access to Bitcoin assets. Existing bridges immobilise liquidity and require bespoke integrations, slowing ecosystem growth.

# Specification

## Validator
| Field        | Value                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Entity       | 3 Commas Capital                      |
| Tier         | 2 (weight 3)                          |
| Role         | Super Validator                       |

## Interoperability Bridge
* **Provider:** deBridge (portfolio company of 3 Commas Capital).  
* **Scope:** connect Canton to EVM, Solana and other supported chains.  
* **Features:** message-based, liquidity-free transfers; extensible IaaS adapter framework.  
* **Timeline:** production release ≤ 4 months after CIP approval.

## Bitcoin Liquidity Integration
* **Provider:** Midl (supported by 3 Commas Capital).  
* **Scope:** integrate Canton into Midl’s infrastructure, enabling direct BTC wallet support and Bitcoin-native assets without wrapping.  
* **Timeline:** ≤ 4 months after CIP approval.

## Pilots
3 Commas Capital will launch 3–5 pilots with Tier-1 financial institutions and corporates in Europe and the Middle East within 6 months.

# Rationale
* **deBridge** already supports EVM, Solana and other ecosystems with fast, liquidity-free transfers and a modular adapter framework, making it a natural fit for Canton integration.  
* **Midl** provides Bitcoin-native smart-contract infrastructure, unlocking BTC liquidity for DeFi use cases without wrapping.  
These components directly address the gaps identified in *Motivation*.

# Backwards Compatibility
Purely additive; no changes to consensus rules or existing smart-contract semantics.

# Reference Implementation
* deBridge Canton adapter (open-sourced under Apache-2.0).  
* Midl Canton integration module (Apache-2.0).

# Security Considerations
* Validators operated with HSM-based key custody, multi-site redundancy and 24 / 7 monitoring.  
* deBridge design removes liquidity pools, reducing attack surface compared to lock-and-mint bridges.  
* Midl employs threshold-signature custody for BTC assets.
