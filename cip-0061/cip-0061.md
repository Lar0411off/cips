# Abstract
Add the joint team of **Midl** and **Tenzor Capital** as a Tier-2 Super Validator (weight 3) on the Canton Network to deliver:

* a production-ready, liquidity-free interoperability bridge between Canton and major chains (EVM, Solana, …) within **4 months** of CIP approval;  
* native support for Bitcoin liquidity and BTC-denominated assets in Canton smart contracts within the same **4 months**;  
* 3–5 pilot projects with leading financial institutions and corporations across Europe and the Middle East within **6 months**.

# About Applicants

Mild:
* Midl is the first Bitcoin-native dApp infrastructure enabling smart contract execution directly on Bitcoin without bridges or custodians.
* Users and developers can interact with DeFi, stablecoins, NFTs, and other EVM-like applications using native BTC wallets - making Bitcoin truly programmable.
* Backed by Draper and other top-tier VCs, Midl is live on testnet, onboarding 20+ projects with audited core modules and early integrations underwaу.

Tenzor Capital:


# Motivation
Canton currently lacks (1) a standardised, production-grade path for cross-chain liquidity and (2) native access to Bitcoin assets. Existing bridges immobilise liquidity and require bespoke integrations, slowing ecosystem growth.

# Specification

## Validator
| Field        | Value                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Entity       | Midl and Tenzor Capital                      |
| Tier         | 2 (weight 3)                          |
| Role         | Super Validator                       |

## Interoperability Bridge
* **Provider:** deBridge (Leading intent based bridge infrastructure).  
* **Scope:** connect Canton to EVM, Solana and other supported chains.  
* **Features:** message-based, liquidity-free transfers; extensible IaaS adapter framework.  
* **Timeline:** production release ≤ 4 months after CIP approval.

## Bitcoin Liquidity Integration
* **Provider:** Midl.  
* **Scope:** integrate Canton into Midl’s infrastructure, enabling direct BTC wallet support and Bitcoin-native assets without wrapping.  
* **Timeline:** ≤ 4 months after CIP approval.

## Pilots
Midl and Tenzor Capital will launch 3–5 pilots with Tier-1 financial institutions and corporates in Europe and the Middle East within 6 months.

| **Deliverable** | **Acceptance Criteria** | **Deadline** | **Weight Earned** |
|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Canton Interoperability Bridge** | Mainnet deployment of deBridge Canton adapter (with security review) | ≤ 4 months from CIP approval | 0.5 |
|  | 1,000 unique wallets used bridge to/from Canton | — | 0.5 |
| **Fractional-Reserve Protocol Launch** | Whitepaper published describing the launch of a fractional-reserve protocol utilizing a self-coordinating, duration-matched autonomous balance sheet | ≤ 6 months from CIP approval | 0.2 |
|  | Smart contracts deployed on Canton | — | 0.3 |
|  | 2,000 unique holders on Canton | — | 0.5 |
| **Bitcoin Integration via Midl** *(requires EVM module readiness on Canton side)* | Midl smart contracts and technical stack prepared for Canton-side EVM integration | ≤ 6 months from CIP approval | 0.5 |
|  | Canton assets usable in Bitcoin-native Midl contracts upon EVM availability | — | 0.5 |


# Milestone Mechanics:
* The GSF Tokenomics committee will evaluate each milestone and verify progress towards the deliverables outlined in this CIP.
* The Midl and Tenzor Capital team will provide a written progress update every 60 days from CIP approval, including updates on user adoption, deployment status, and technical integration milestones.


# Rationale
* **deBridge** already supports EVM, Solana and other ecosystems with fast, liquidity-free transfers and a modular adapter framework, making it a natural fit for Canton integration.  
* **Midl** provides Bitcoin-native smart-contract infrastructure, unlocking BTC liquidity for DeFi use cases without wrapping. Integration enables institutional Canton liquidity (US Treasuries, stablecoins, tokenized securities) to be used within a Bitcoin-native environment. Canton assets become programmable in Midl contracts for lending, AMMs and derivatives - all with compliant and secure execution.
These components directly address the gaps identified in *Motivation*.

# Backwards Compatibility
Purely additive; no changes to consensus rules or existing smart-contract semantics.

# Reference Implementation
* deBridge Canton adapter (open-sourced under Apache-2.0).  
* Midl Canton integration module (Apache-2.0).

# Security Considerations
* Validators operated with HSM-based key custody, multi-site redundancy and 24 / 7 monitoring.  
* deBridge design removes liquidity pools, reducing attack surface compared to lock-and-mint bridges.  
* Midl employs threshold-signature custody for BTC assets.
