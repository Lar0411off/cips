# Abstract
**Tenzor Capital** proposes to join the Canton Network as a Super Validator (weight 5) by integrating two of its portfolio companies - **Midl** and **deBridge** - into  **Canton’s infrastructure**.

Through coordinated technical delivery and performance-driven adoption goals, **Tenzor Capital** will deliver:
* Cross-chain liquidity via  **deBridge** - Mainnet deployment of a Canton adapter enabling secure, high-throughput asset transfers between Canton and other chains, with seamless wallet onboarding for users bridging in and out of Canton.
* Bitcoin integration via  **Midl** - Enabling Canton assets to be used in Bitcoin-native smart contracts once EVM support is live, attracting liquidity from both EVM ecosystems and native Bitcoin holders.

These integrations will address Canton’s current limitations in native Bitcoin access and cross-chain liquidity, while driving measurable adoption through wallet connections, transaction volumes and protocol usage.


# About Applicants
**Tenzor Capital:**
* Early-stage Web3 venture firm operating a $50M liquid stable-asset fund.
* Backed 25+ infrastructure and DeFi projects since 2017.
* Strong technical team with experience in yield-bearing vault infrastructure, stable-asset mechanics, on-chain automations, bridging solutions and user interface design.
* Strategic position as both investor and coordinator enables smooth alignment of technical roadmaps and delivery timelines across portfolio companies for Canton-focused integrations.

Portfolio companies in scope:
* **Midl** - Bitcoin-native smart contract infrastructure enabling DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs using native BTC wallets, designed to attract liquidity from both EVM ecosystems and native Bitcoin.
* **deBridge** - Cross-chain interoperability protocol for secure asset and message transfers, unlocking production-grade, scalable liquidity flows across multiple blockchains.

# Motivation
Current challenges in **Canton**:
* No standardised, production-ready path for cross-chain liquidity - current solutions lock up liquidity and require custom integrations, slowing growth.
* No direct access to native Bitcoin assets - existing solutions rely on wrapped tokens or custodians, limiting adoption from Bitcoin-native users.

How this proposal solves them:
* **deBridge** integration - Delivers a ready-to-use, audited Canton adapter for high-speed, secure bridging of assets and messages between Canton and other chains.
* **Midl** integration - Allows Canton assets to interact directly with Bitcoin-native smart contracts, tapping into the largest crypto asset base and increasing liquidity inflow.

# Specification


## Interoperability Bridge
* **Provider:** deBridge (Leading intent based bridge infrastructure).  
* **Scope:** connect Canton to EVM, Solana and other supported chains.  
* **Features:** message-based, liquidity-free transfers; extensible IaaS adapter framework.  
* **Timeline:** production release ≤ 6 months after CIP approval.

## Bitcoin Liquidity Integration
* **Provider:** Midl.  
* **Scope:** integrate Canton into Midl’s infrastructure, enabling direct BTC wallet support and Bitcoin-native assets without wrapping.  
* **Timeline:** ≤ 6 months after CIP approval.

# Deliverables for full SV Reward:

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |
|-------------|--------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Midl Whitepaper** | • Whitepaper describing technical architecture and integration process published before go-live. | ≤ 3 months from CIP approval | 0.2 |
| **Midl Integration – Technical Delivery** | • Midl smart contracts & technical stack prepared for Canton-side EVM integration.<br>• Security review passed.<br>• Canton assets usable in Bitcoin-native Midl contracts upon EVM availability. | ≤ 6 months from CIP approval | **1.0 total** — 0.6 contracts ready, 0.3 security review, 0.1 assets live |
| **Midl Performance KPI** | • +0.3 per 1000 unique Canton wallets interacting with Bitcoin-native Midl contracts. |  | Max 1.5 |
| **deBridge Whitepaper** | • Whitepaper describing bridging architecture and Canton adapter implementation published before go-live. | ≤ 3 months from CIP approval | 0.2 |
| **deBridge Integration – Technical Delivery** | • Security review passed.<br>• Mainnet deployment of deBridge Canton adapter. | ≤ 6 months from CIP approval | **1.0 total** — 0.3 security review, 0.7 mainnet deployment|
| **deBridge Performance KPI** | • +0.3 per 1,000 unique wallets bridged to/from Canton. |  | Max 1.5 |

**Total Weight Possible:** 5.0

# Milestone Mechanics:
* The GSF Tokenomics committee will evaluate each milestone and verify progress towards the deliverables outlined in this CIP.
* Tenzor Capital team will provide a written progress update every 60 days from CIP approval, including updates on user adoption, deployment status, and technical integration milestones.

# Rationale
* **deBridge** already supports EVM, Solana and other ecosystems with fast, liquidity-free transfers and a modular adapter framework, making it a natural fit for Canton integration.  
* **Midl** provides Bitcoin-native smart-contract infrastructure, unlocking BTC liquidity for DeFi use cases without wrapping. Integration enables institutional Canton liquidity (US Treasuries, stablecoins, tokenized securities) to be used within a Bitcoin-native environment. Canton assets become programmable in Midl contracts for lending, AMMs and derivatives - all with compliant and secure execution.
These components directly address the gaps identified in *Motivation*.

# Backwards Compatibility
Purely additive; no changes to consensus rules or existing smart-contract semantics.

# Reference Implementation
* deBridge Canton adapter (open-sourced under Apache-2.0).  
* Midl Canton integration module (Apache-2.0).

# Security Considerations
* Validators operated with HSM-based key custody, multi-site redundancy and 24 / 7 monitoring.  
* deBridge design removes liquidity pools, reducing attack surface compared to lock-and-mint bridges.  
* Midl employs threshold-signature custody for BTC assets.

## SV Mechanics

- An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the **escrowed** Super Validator will be set up by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight in the CIP that granted rights to that Super Validator.
  - The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV.
  - The escrow SV will **not** mint rewards on a block-by-block basis.
  - All escrow SV rewards will go to the **Unclaimed Rewards** pool.

- **2/3 of the Super Validator Operators** will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator.

- The Applicant is required to present proof of successfully completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group.
  - The Applicant must present a calculation for the number of *Canton Coin* it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone.

- If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing list.
  - The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator.
  - **2/3 of Super Validator Operators** will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics Working Group.

- If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline:
  - The Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF.
  - Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
  - The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the **Unclaimed Rewards**.

- The Applicant is subject to **CIP-0045: SV Operating Requirements**.
  - If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight `> 2.5`, they are required to operate their SV within **6 months** of crossing that Weight.
